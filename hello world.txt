Hello world! What do I think of using github for a place to share my thoughts?

Text. Text! This is where the action is.

Version control. Licenses. If I'm "just talking", what do I need formatting for?

Plain text was once all there was for talking. Bulletin board systems. Usenet. ICQ. Command line!

When it comes to code management in 2019, what are the tools/features that programmers are using?

I imagine that this (code repositories) are the pragmatic "edge"/frontier of plain text management.

Interroperable-idea management.

I'm in no one's social media ecosystem. I am unburdened from thinking about html and formatting. 

I AM FREE!!!!!!!!!!

What do I see along the top? "Issues". Hmmm, I wonder how I can use that. "Pull requests" -- what are those? Projects. Sure! But what are my projects?

Oh that previous line started getting long.

Do I want to have long lines of thoughts, or just short ones? What will this read like on a telephone?

Oooh I love the "soft wrap" / "no wrap" option in the top right corner. Give me that control!!!

     Spaces.
		 Whoa. It did the spaces automatically.
		 	Tab. I just tabbed.
				I tabbed again.
					Another tab.
					     Spaces that time. 5 of them.
							 Auto.
							 OK get me back to the left margin again.
Shift-tab seemed to do it.

OK, back on solid ground again.

"Security". "Settings". Insights? What's going on over there?

"Unwatch" / watch. Be notified when @mentioned. "Conversations." I just starred this.

When would one want to "fork" a conversational txt file? Hmmm.

In the beginning, God created the heaven and earth. OK I'm done for the day!
